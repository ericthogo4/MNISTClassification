# MNISTClassificationTask

This is a repository of a program that uses a two layer neural network to classify images of the MNIST dataset.

It uses tensorflow's keras to fetch the dataset. The training dataset (60, 000 images) is used to train a model while the testing dataset (10, 000 images) is used for its evaluation.
